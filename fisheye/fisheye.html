  <h1>Graph Distortions</h1>
  <h4>Fisheye vs. Cartesian</h4>

    This project will look at two different distortion techniques.  Both graphs focus on the Twitter accounts 
    of cast members from popular movies (and the greatest TV show of all time, Breaking Bad).  For each graph,
    the number of people the cast member follows is on the x-axis and the number of followers he or she has is
    on the y-axis.  The number of tweets determine the radius of the cast member's representative circle, and 
    each circle's color is determined by the movie from which the cast member played a role.  In order to view
    more data for each point, simply hover the mouse over the circle, and all data will be displayed.

  <p>
      It can be difficult to observe micro and macro features simultaneously with complex graphs.
      If you zoom in for detail, the graph is too big to view in its entirety.
      If you zoom out to see the overall structure, small details are lost.
      <a href="http://infovis-wiki.net/wiki/Focus-plus-Context">Focus + context</a>
      techniques allow interactive exploration of an area of interest (the <i>focus</i>) in greater detail,
      while preserving the surrounding environment (the <i>context</i>).
  </p>
  <h2>Fisheye Distortion</h2>
  <p>Fisheye distortion is a technique that attempts to enhance focus by enlarging a circular area.  In order
    to preserve context, fisheye distortion compresses the area near the circumference, so that any area outside
    of the circle of focus is not pushed outward.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the graph above, <b>fisheye distortion</b> magnifies the local region around the mouse,
    while leaving the larger graph unaffected for context. The localized, circular nature of the distortion
    can be seen clearly by applying it to a uniform grid:
  </p>
  <p id="chart2"></p>
  <p>
    This type of distortion is particularly useful for disambiguating edge-crossings in static network layouts:
    edges between distant nodes are distorted more strongly than local ones.
  </p>
  <h2>Cartesian Distortion</h2>
  <p>
    Circular fisheye is only one of many possible distortion functions.
    Two disadvantages of circular distortion are that it compresses (rather than magnifies)
    the area near the circumference of the circle, and that it requires curved grid lines to show the distortion accurately.
    The latter makes it unsuitable for visualizations that have quantitative position encodings, such as scatterplots.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=142763">Sarkar and Brown</a> recommend
    a different function that magnifies continuously so as to avoid local minification.
    Furthermore, they demonstrate applying the distortion to each dimension separately, resulting in <i>Cartesian distortion</i>:
  </p>
  <p id="chart3"></p>
  <p>
    With this technique, straight lines parallel to the <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> axis remain straight even after distortion.
    This means you can use standard axes in conjunction with fisheye distortion in scatterplots:
  </p>
  <p id="chart4"></p>
  <p>
    Fisheye distortion allows you to zoom into small areas of the chart without losing sense of the overall distribution.
    With distortion, you can easily differentiate individual countries while retaining context.
  </p>
  <h2>Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    These examples use D3’s <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/tree/master/fisheye">fisheye plugin</a>,
    which supports both circular and Cartesian distortion.
    The latter is implemented on top of D3’s <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Quantitative-Scales">quantitative scales</a>,
    allowing distortion of linear, logarithmic, and exponential scales, as well as compatibility with D3’s
    <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Axes">axis component</a>. For additional implementations,
    see <a href="http://flare.prefuse.org">Flare</a> and <a href="http://sigmajs.org">Sigma.js</a>.
